# FJS_Algorithm
Franek-Jennings-Smyth Algorithm, written in C++ language, achieves faster string matching than traditional well-known algorithms like KMP and BMS. This algorithm incorporates the best parts (i.e., the worst-case handling of KMP and the optimal average and best-case handling of BMS).
